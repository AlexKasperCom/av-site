# ABOUT ME
I was born in Ireland and immigrated to Canada as a teenager. I learned my trade in Montréal as an apprentice under the best stylists, influenced by a fashion-savvy, diverse crew of Americans, Québécois, and Anglophone Canadians.

I was running my own salon, Level 3, in downtown Montréal when I met my (now) husband, and love brought the life adventure back to Europe. I chose Berlin to set up shop anew and to learn another language, as always, with a dreadful accent.

After nine years abroad, we returned to Montréal in 2022.

I was born in Ireland and immigrated to Canada as a teenager. I learned my trade in Montréal as an apprentice, influenced by a fashion-savvy, diverse crew of Americans, French Quebecois, and Canadians. I also spent time honing my skills under a Manhattan stylist.

I was running my own salon, Level 3, in downtown Montréal when I met my (now) husband, and love brought the life adventure back to Europe. I chose Berlin to set up shop anew, where I was often sought after for my knowledge of North American styles. I also learned another language, as always, with a dreadful accent. I'm now fluent in English, French, and German, and I'm likely the only Montréal hairstylist to also hold a German *Handwerkskammer Meister-Zertifikat*. Whether it's a modern cut or balayage, I relish making the difficult simple.
