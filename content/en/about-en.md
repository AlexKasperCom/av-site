# ABOUT ME
Originally from Ireland, I immigrated to Canada as a teenager and learned my trade in Montréal as an apprentice under the best stylists, influenced by a fashion-savvy, diverse crew of Americans and Québécois.

I was running my own salon, Level 3, in downtown Montréal when I met my (now) husband. Love took me on a new adventure to Berlin, where I worked as a *Friseurin* and learned German—though always with a dreadful accent.

We moved back to Montréal in 2022.

I love to blend European style with North American finishes and particularly enjoy cutting "difficult" hair and curls. I specialize in creating layered, dimensional, "lived-in" colour and cuts. I'm very fond of Balayage and am devoted to studying and discovering new industry trends.

I'm likely the only Montréal hairstylist who holds a German <span class="ns-tooltip">*Meisterbrief*.
  <span class="ns-tooltip-text">
    A German "Meisterbrief" (Master Craftsman Certificate) is Germany’s highest professional qualification in a     trade. It places hairdressers at the same master level as master carpenters, master bakers,
    master electricians, and master plumbers, and certifies both advanced expertise and
    the ability to train apprentices and operate an independent craft business.
