# ALISON VERMAAT
Colour services and cuts with stunning precision. Alison Vermaat loves style.

She apprenticed under a Manhattan stylist, owned a salon in Montréal, and was sought after for her knowledge of North American style while living in Berlin.

From modern cuts to balayage, Alison relishes making the difficult simple. Fluent in English, French, and now German, she's likely the only Montréal hairstylist to also hold a German *Handwerkskammer Meister-Zertifikat*.
